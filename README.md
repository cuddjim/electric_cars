This program uses data from www.plugndrive.ca to create a sortable database of all EV and PHEVs currently available in Canada.

Potential developments are to create a Shiny app from the aforementioned data to create basic visuals and a dynamic version of the table created from the get_ev_data.R script.

No other uses are foreseen at this time.
